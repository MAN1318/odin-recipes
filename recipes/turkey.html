        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Turkey</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
            <li>Turkez Stock</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place a rack in the lowest position of the oven.</li>
            <li>Remove turkey neck and giblets. Rinse turkey and pat dry with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Place turkey, breast-side up, on a rack in a roasting pan. Loosely fill turkey cavity with stuffing. Rub skin with butter, then season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Pour 2 cups of turkey stock into the roasting pan. Loosely tent turkey with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Roast turkey for 2 1/2 hours, basting with pan juices every 30 minutes. When drippings evaporate, add remaining stock to the pan, 1 to 2 cups at a time.</li>
            <li>Remove foil and continue roasting until a meat thermometer inserted in thickest part of thigh reads 165 degrees F (75 degrees C), about 1 1/2 hours more.</li>
            <li>Transfer turkey to a large serving platter. Let stand for 20 to 30 minutes before carving.</li>
        </ol>
